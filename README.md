TLS Lab - ENCS5322

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) Lab as part of the **ENCS5322** course at the **Faculty of Engineering & Technology, Electrical & Computer Engineering Department**.

Overview

This lab explores the fundamentals of **TLS** and its role in securing communication over networks. It guides students through implementing:

*  A **TLS Client** to understand the handshake process, certificate validation, and secure data exchange.
*  A **TLS Server** with custom certificates and Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
*  A **Simple HTTPS Proxy** to demonstrate vulnerabilities such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Through these hands-on exercises, students gain practical experience in **TLS**, **PKI**, and **HTTPS**, preparing them to secure real-world applications.

##  Contents

* `handshake.py`: Implements a TLS client performing a handshake and data retrieval.
* `server.py`: Implements a basic TLS server serving HTML content over HTTPS.
* `client-certs/`: Directory for custom CA certificates used by the client.
* `server-certs/`: Directory for server certificates and private keys.
* `san_config.cnf`: OpenSSL configuration for generating certificates with SANs.
* `README.md`: This file.

##  How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* OpenSSL
* Docker (optional for containerized environment)
* Wireshark (for network traffic analysis)

###  Run the TLS Client

```bash
cd client
python3 handshake.py www.google.com
```

This will:

* Establish a TLS handshake
* Validate server certificates
* Send and receive data securely

###  Run the TLS Server

```bash
cd server
python3 server.py
```

Ensure the server certificates (`server.crt` and `server.key`) exist in the `server-certs/` directory.

###  Simulate HTTPS Proxy (MITM)

Follow the instructions in the lab document to set up hosts redirection and run the MITM proxy.

## Key Features

*  TLS handshake with real-world servers (Google, Example.com)
*  Custom CA directory for certificate validation
*  Certificate generation with SAN support
*  MITM attack demonstration using HTTPS proxy
